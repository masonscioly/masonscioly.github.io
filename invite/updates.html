		<h3 style="text-align: left;" class="major"><span style="font-family: Quicksand;">UPDATE 5 (October 19th)<br>
		</span></h3>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			We are officially <strong>4 weeks away</strong> from the start of the 2025 Mason Satellite Invitational; at this moment approximately 180 teams have registered (you can find a full list <a href="https://scilympiad.com/oh-mason/Reg/School">here</a>). Here are a couple of logistical updates.
			<br><br>
			We realize that many coaches/students competing may not have used the Scilympiad platform for a couple of seasons. If you need a refresher on how to navigate the platform, the head coach guide can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C89iAxOcoc6cH4OIqX9pm5p88cta7X6931HrJCgmOeY/edit?tab=t.0">here</a>, and the student guide can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_e-9ChGJRhjaOCdEa4wn9sEpOPfH2KdWdKyDq8O6u-g/edit?tab=t.0">here</a>. If you have any issues with Scilympiad, be sure to reach out.
			<br><br>
			<strong><u>Awards Ceremony:</u></strong> The awards ceremony for our tournament will be on <strong>Sunday, December 1st</strong>, with the pre-awards ceremony beginning at 6:30 PM, the Division B awards beginning at 7:00 PM, and the Division C awards beginning at 8:00 PM. All times listed are in <strong>EST</strong>. We will be recognizing the <strong>top 6 teams</strong> in each event, as well as the <strong>top 6 schools</strong> overall in each division. If multiple teams from the same school place within the top 6 overall, we will only consider the higher placing team. Additionally, the top 6 teams from each event will be entered into a special raffle to win one of our <strong>special event prizes</strong> which will be revealed during the awards ceremony. Our list of previous awards can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SmIgb2a6gZ6JXyyMJguoTXQjc3III0metWB-Xc6MsjU/edit?tab=t.0">here</a>.
			<br><br>
			Our official results will be published on <a href="https://duosmium.org/">Duosmium</a> following the ceremony.
			<br><br>
			<strong><u>Team Names/Numbers:</u></strong> For every team that is competing at our invitational, a team name must be selected. You can do this by going into the <a href="https://scilympiad.com/oh-mason/ForHcs/HcDB">Head Coach Dasboard</a>, pressing the “Register/Update Teams” button, and then pressing the “Edit” button. When you do this, please <strong>do not</strong> keep your school name in the team name. For example, if your team names are White and Orange, please leave your team name as “White” instead of “Mason High School White”. You may set your team name to anything, though please be aware that we will have to attempt to say these names during the awards ceremony.
			<br><br>
			Team numbers will be initially assigned on <strong>November 1st</strong>. At this time, you will be able to go into Scilympiad and assign students to certain teams/events to prepare for the competition to begin. 
			<strong><u>Event Modifications:</u></strong> The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DH-iihUoC804X1Pc_ljJNJup2v4iWDgvNkIxl5eJniQ/edit?usp=sharing">Event Modifications document</a> has had a couple slight changes since our last communication summarized below (as well as some helpful reminders):
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>The Materials list for <strong>Write It Do It B</strong> has been changed to include more materials other than notebook paper</li>
				<li>For <strong>Optics C</strong>, competitors will need a <strong>straightedge</strong>, as well as a printed copy (in color) of the image sheet provided.</li>
				<li>For <strong>Codebusters B/C</strong>, 3 copies of the reference sheet as well as a copy of certain problems from the test must be printed and given to competitors. This document does <strong>not</strong> need to be in color, and will be published by <strong>November 9th</strong>. </li>
				<li>Materials lists for <strong>Experimental Design B/C</strong> have been posted, please note that not all materials will be allowed for the experiment and a subset of those materials will be provided on the Scilympiad test. Please instruct your students to <strong>read this list carefully</strong>, as it will be a 0.95x multiplier to their score if they utilize materials that are not contained on this subset.</li>
				<li>All test events are being run using <strong>state/national</strong> level topics as provided on the rules. All build events will be using <strong>invitational/regional</strong> level rules as listed.</li>
			</ul>
			<strong><u>Event Supervisors:</u></strong> Our Event Supervisor list can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dclxzd-9p1TJISUae1Rx_RYpVXp-qibk16uPdPrGcM8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> for Division B and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WkGarmDMg1ENTa4T6Xx3qBFcvr-hyxijlH4o1kKbdjE/edit?gid=0#gid=0">here</a> for Division C. Short introductions for each supervisor as well as a picture will be posted on <a href="https://www.masonscioly.org/invite.html">our website</a> shortly.
